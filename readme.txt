Desktop Skeleton - A qooxdoo Application Template
==================================================

Using Natural Language to teach ML models how to trade stocks, abstracts away from using programming languages and uses English instead.

This is a qooxdoo application skeleton which is used as a template. The 
'create-application.py' script (usually under tool/bin/create-application.py)
will use this and expand it into a self-contained qooxdoo application which 
can then be further extended. Please refer to the script and other documentation
for further information.
